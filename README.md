## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - Web Application: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, WebAssembly (Rust)
  - Mobile Application: React Native with SQLite and background services
- **Backend**:
  - API Gateway: Go (Fiber/Chi) with JWT auth and rate limiting
  - Real-time Services: Elixir (Phoenix) with WebSockets and PubSub
  - Computation Services: Rust (Actix-web) with WebAssembly compilation
  - Cache & State: Gleam with distributed state handling
- **Database & Storage**:
  - Primary: PostgreSQL for user accounts, content, and settings
  - Cache: Redis + browser cache + service workers
  - Files: S3/GCS + CDN + local storage for offline access

## üß† System Components
### AI System
- **General Purpose Assistant**: Academic guidance, study tips, research help
- **Math & Physics Assistant**: LaTeX rendering, visualization, step-by-step solving
- **Computer Science Assistant**: Code completion, syntax highlighting, compilation
- **Document Analysis Assistant**: Multi-format support, extraction, summarization

### Offline-First System
- **Local Storage**: SQLite, IndexedDB, Service Worker caching
- **Sync System**: Background sync, conflict resolution, delta updates

### Calendar System
- **AI-powered scheduling** with study time allocation and break reminders
- **Intelligence Layer** for pattern recognition and personalized scheduling

## üîí Security & Privacy
- JWT-based authentication with OAuth2 and MFA
- End-to-end encryption for messages
- At-rest encryption for stored data
- Client-side encryption for offline data

## üìà Scalability & Performance
- Docker containerization with Kubernetes orchestration
- Edge caching, lazy loading, and code splitting
- WASM for compute-intensive tasks
- Horizontal scaling and load balancing

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics
- Prometheus metrics with Grafana dashboards
- User engagement and feature usage tracking
- Performance analytics and A/B testing

## üóìÔ∏è Implementation Phases
1. **Core Platform** (3 months): Auth, notes, general AI, basic calendar
2. **Advanced Features** (3 months): Specialized AI, document analysis, IDE, offline
3. **Mobile & Integration** (2 months): Mobile app, third-party integrations, AI features
4. **Enhancement & Scale** (2 months): Analytics, additional AI, infrastructure scaling

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/zephyr-v2.git
   cd zephyr-v2
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
4. Start the development environment
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   pnpm dev
   ```
5. Access the application
   - Web: http://localhost:3000
   - API: http://localhost:4000
   - Documentation: http://localhost:5000

## Additional Considerations
- Each package and service has its own configuration files
- Service-specific files include Go modules, Cargo files, mix files
- Documentation is maintained at root level and per-service
- Development environment uses Docker Compose and Make commands

## üöÄ Future Plans
- AR/VR support for visualization
- AI-powered study group matching
- Integrated plagiarism detection
- Geographic expansion and multi-tenant support
